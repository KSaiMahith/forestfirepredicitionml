# Forest Fire Predicition using ML
Forest fires are a serious environmental issue that cause extensive economic and ecological damage, and they put lives at risk. These fires, which can occur spontaneously in forests, grasslands, or scrublands, are sometimes difficult to control. Predicting forest fires is crucial for effective fire management, helping with everything from allocating resources to planning recovery efforts.

Many factors contribute to the likelihood of a forest fire, such as geographical coordinates and meteorological conditions like temperature, humidity, wind, sunlight hours, and precipitation. Understanding how these variables interact and affect the risk of a fire, as well as estimating its potential impact, often requires sophisticated machine learning techniques.
